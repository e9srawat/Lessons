Your assignment today is to read Chapters 1 through 5 of the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) and to summarize your key learnings in proper MarkDown in the self-referencing blank files in this repo.

1. [Whetting Your Appetite](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html)
2. [Using the Python Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html)
3. [An Informal Introduction to Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html)
4. [More Control Flow Tools](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)
5. [Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

You will be judged on the quality of your understanding, the quality of your writing, and the quality of the markdown that you generate.

Understanding is important. 

Content is important.
